Track the movies I watch and associated metadata

<!--more-->

### plan

IFTTT recipe: IMDB page, Pocket w/ tag "video-checkin" -> google sheet

Other pocket tags:

- venue: `hbo`, `netflix`, `amazon`, `theater`, `cable`, `airplane`, `hotel`...
- cost: `free`, `$` (rent), `$$` (buy)
- first-watch vs. re-watch

### questions
- how many movies did i watch this year?
- which venues do I use most?
- Do i pay for movies?
- Of the movies I watched last year, which decades did I frequent the most?
