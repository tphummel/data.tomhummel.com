When is it legitimate to check in to a movie?

<!--more-->

### Rule

For movies I've seen before, rewatching as little as 15 minutes warrants a checkin - even if I enter in the middle of the movie.

For first viewings, I check in at the beginning if I intend to see the entire movie. It is ok if the viewing is spread across more than one day.
