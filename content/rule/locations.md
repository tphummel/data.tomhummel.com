When is it legitimate to check in to a location?

<!--more-->

### Rule
You **can** check in if you are physically at a venue and **any** of the below apply:

- you conduct commerce or other transaction, or you intend to do so.
- you spend at least 10 minutes there.
- someone completes a transaction at the venue on your behalf while you are very near.

You **cannot** check in if:

- you receive a delivery from the location but you aren't physically there.
- the venue is not open.

### Other notes

- it is legitimate to checkin to sub-venues. ex: you've already checked in to the airport, then you check in to a restaurant inside the airport where you eat lunch before your flight.
